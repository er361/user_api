# Security Fixes Applied

## Summary
This document outlines all security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the User Balance API.

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### 1. IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) - CRITICAL ✅
**Severity:** Critical
**Issue:** Routes exposed user IDs in URLs (`/users/{id}`), allowing attackers to manipulate IDs and access other users' resources.

**Fix:**
- Changed routes to use `/me` endpoint for user operations
- User ID now obtained from authenticated session token, not URL
- Admin-only endpoint for balance updates uses policy-based authorization
- Files modified:
  - `routes/api.php`
  - `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`

### 2. Information Disclosure via Timing Attacks - HIGH ✅
**Severity:** High
**Issue:** Different response times for existing vs non-existing users allowed enumeration of valid user IDs.

**Fix:**
- Added random delays (100-300ms) for failed user lookups
- Use `User::find()` instead of `User::findOrFail()` to control response messaging
- Consistent error messages regardless of whether user exists
- Files modified:
  - `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`

### 3. Missing Rate Limiting Configuration - CRITICAL ✅
**Severity:** Critical
**Issue:** No defined rate limits allowed brute force attacks and DoS.

**Fix:**
- General API: 60 requests/minute
- Transfers: 10 requests/minute
- Admin operations: 30 requests/minute
- Files modified:
  - `bootstrap/app.php`

### 4. Floating Point Precision Issues - HIGH ✅
**Severity:** High
**Issue:** Using `float` for money calculations causes precision loss and rounding errors.

**Fix:**
- Replaced all float operations with bcmath functions
- Added validation for exactly 2 decimal places
- Normalized all amounts to 2 decimal format
- Files modified:
  - `app/Actions/User/TransferBalanceAction.php`
  - `app/Actions/User/UpdateUserBalanceAction.php`
  - `app/Http/Requests/TransferBalanceRequest.php`
  - `app/Http/Requests/UpdateUserBalanceRequest.php`

### 5. Missing Balance Upper Bound - MEDIUM ✅
**Severity:** Medium
**Issue:** No maximum balance constraint could lead to integer overflow or unrealistic values.

**Fix:**
- Added database constraint: max balance 999,999,999.99
- Updated validation rules to match constraint
- Added regex validation for decimal format
- Files created:
  - `database/migrations/2025_11_01_000000_add_max_balance_constraint.php`
- Files modified:
  - `app/Http/Requests/UpdateUserBalanceRequest.php`
  - `app/Http/Requests/TransferBalanceRequest.php`

### 6. Missing Admin Authorization - CRITICAL ✅
**Severity:** Critical
**Issue:** Direct balance update endpoint had no admin-only check.

**Fix:**
- Added `is_admin` field to users table
- Created `updateAnyBalance` policy for admin-only access
- Updated controller to check policy before allowing balance updates
- Files created:
  - `database/migrations/2025_11_01_000001_add_is_admin_to_users_table.php`
- Files modified:
  - `app/Models/User.php`
  - `app/Policies/UserPolicy.php`
  - `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`

### 7. Race Condition in Concurrent Transfers - HIGH ✅
**Severity:** High
**Issue:** Insufficient locking could lead to double-spending in high concurrency scenarios.

**Fix:**
- Added deterministic lock ordering (by ID)
- Added verification that users still exist after lock
- Used `lockForUpdate()` with proper transaction isolation
- Improved error handling for race conditions
- Files modified:
  - `app/Actions/User/TransferBalanceAction.php`

### 8. No Transfer Confirmation/2FA - MEDIUM ✅
**Severity:** Medium
**Issue:** Compromised tokens could instantly transfer all funds.

**Fix:**
- Implemented 2-step transfer flow
- Step 1: Initiate transfer → returns confirmation token
- Step 2: Confirm with token → executes transfer
- Tokens expire after 15 minutes
- One-time use tokens
- Legacy endpoint kept for backward compatibility (marked deprecated)
- Files created:
  - `database/migrations/2025_11_01_000002_create_transfer_confirmations_table.php`
  - `app/Models/TransferConfirmation.php`
  - `app/Http/Requests/InitiateTransferRequest.php`
  - `app/Http/Requests/ConfirmTransferRequest.php`
  - `app/Actions/User/InitiateTransferAction.php`
- Files modified:
  - `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`
  - `routes/api.php`

## API Changes

### Breaking Changes
- `PUT /v1/users/{id}` → `PUT /v1/me`
- `POST /v1/users/{id}/transfer-balance` → `POST /v1/me/transfer-balance` (deprecated)

### New Endpoints
- `POST /v1/me/transfers/initiate` - Start transfer (step 1)
- `POST /v1/me/transfers/confirm` - Confirm transfer (step 2)
- `PUT /v1/users/{id}/balance` - Admin-only balance update

### Required Migration
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will apply:
1. Add `is_admin` column to users table
2. Add max balance constraint (999,999,999.99)
3. Create `transfer_confirmations` table

## Additional Recommendations

### Not Implemented (Future Enhancements)
1. **Use UUIDs instead of auto-increment IDs** - More secure, prevents enumeration
2. **Add IP whitelisting for admin endpoints** - Extra layer of protection
3. **Implement webhook notifications** - Alert users of transfers
4. **Add email/SMS confirmation** - True 2FA for high-value transfers
5. **Audit logging service** - Centralized security event monitoring
6. **Add daily/monthly transfer limits** - Prevent large-scale theft
7. **Implement account freezing** - Suspicious activity detection
8. **Add TOTP/authenticator support** - Stronger authentication

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Tests to Add
1. Test rate limiting enforcement
2. Test IDOR prevention (cannot access other users)
3. Test concurrent transfer race conditions
4. Test bcmath precision with edge cases
5. Test expired confirmation tokens
6. Test admin-only policy enforcement
7. Test timing attack resistance

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run migrations
- [ ] Set at least one user as admin (`is_admin = true`)
- [ ] Update API documentation with new endpoints
- [ ] Update client applications to use new `/me` endpoints
- [ ] Configure proper rate limiting in production
- [ ] Enable query logging for security monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed authorization attempts

## Notes
- Legacy endpoints kept for backward compatibility but should be deprecated
- All monetary values now use bcmath for precision
- Random delays may increase response times by 100-300ms for security
