## Critical Security Features Tested

### ✅ 1. IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
- Users can only update their own profile via `/me`
- Cannot manipulate URL parameters to access other users
- Admin endpoints properly authorized

### ✅ 2. Mass Assignment Protection
- `is_admin` field is guarded
- Cannot become admin via registration or update

### ✅ 3. Authentication & Authorization
- Unauthenticated requests are rejected
- Admin-only endpoints enforce `is_admin` policy
- Unauthorized attempts are logged

### ✅ 4. Rate Limiting
- API: 60 requests/minute
- Transfers: 10 requests/minute
- Admin: 30 requests/minute
- Per-user enforcement

### ✅ 5. Token Security
- 64-character random tokens
- Expires in 15 minutes
- One-time use
- Max 3 failed attempts before blocking
- User-specific (cannot use another user's token)

### ✅ 6. Transfer Confirmation (2FA)
- Two-step flow: initiate → confirm
- Balance validated at confirmation time
- Tokens cannot be reused
- Self-transfer prevented

### ✅ 7. Race Conditions
- Deterministic lock ordering (prevents deadlocks)
- SERIALIZABLE isolation level
- Both users locked before any updates
- Balance checked after lock acquisition
- Transactions rollback on failure

### ✅ 8. Balance Precision
- All operations use bcmath
- Exactly 2 decimal places

## Running Tests

### Run all tests:
```bash
php artisan test
```

### Run specific test suite:
```bash
# Feature tests only
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature

# Unit tests only
php artisan test --testsuite=Unit

# Specific test file
php artisan test tests/Feature/Api/UserSecurityTest.php

# Specific test method
php artisan test --filter test_user_cannot_update_another_users_profile
```

### Run with coverage:
```bash
php artisan test --coverage
```

### Run in parallel:
```bash
php artisan test --parallel
```

---

## Test Database

Tests use SQLite in-memory database by default for speed. Configuration in `phpunit.xml`:

```xml
<env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
<env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
```

For PostgreSQL-specific tests (like SERIALIZABLE isolation), use:
```bash
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql php artisan test
```

---

## CI/CD Integration

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:

---

## Continuous Testing

### Watch mode (for development):
```bash
# Install pest watch mode
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-watch --dev

# Run in watch mode
./vendor/bin/pest --watch
```

### Pre-commit hook:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

php artisan test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```

---

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests Checklist:
1. ✅ Name test methods descriptively (`test_user_cannot_do_something`)
2. ✅ Use `RefreshDatabase` trait for database tests
3. ✅ Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
4. ✅ One assertion per concept
5. ✅ Test both success and failure cases
6. ✅ Add docblock describing what is tested

### Best Practices:
- Keep tests independent (no shared state)
- Use factories for test data
- Mock external services
- Test edge cases and boundaries
- Verify database state, not just responses
